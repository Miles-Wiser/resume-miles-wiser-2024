      <h2>GameMaker Studios 2</h2>
      <p><a href="https://gamemaker.io/en" target="_blank">GameMaker Studios 2</a> is game engine that uses GML, a custom programming language similar to C++ and Javascript.</p>
      <p>As with many people, I find games, more specifically video games, to be entertaining and relaxing. Since my youth, I've alawys desired to create my very own world and see it displayed in the real world. The combination of these two elements, along with my desire to code, led me to GameMaker.</p>

        <p>A. K. Dewdney proposed a population dynamics simulation. If there are only two species on a planet, one a fish the other sharks, how might they live. With various factors such as starting fish/sharks, breeding rates, and age limits how might they live. This is my recreation.</p>

        <p>As I stated before, it has always been my dream to make my own world and bring it into reality. This is the medium I chose.</p>
